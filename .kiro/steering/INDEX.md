## 🎯 Usage Guide

### Getting Started

1. **New Developer**: Read all three documents in order
   - PROGRAMMING_PRACTICES.md (foundation)
   - ARCHITECTURE.md (system design)
   - TESTING_STANDARDS.md (quality assurance)

2. **Writing Code**: Reference PROGRAMMING_PRACTICES.md
   - Keep methods short
   - Use clear naming
   - Document with JavaDoc
   - Follow Java conventions

3. **Designing Features**: Reference ARCHITECTURE.md
   - Understand layering
   - Choose appropriate patterns
   - Apply SOLID principles
   - Plan exception handling

4. **Writing Tests**: Reference TESTING_STANDARDS.md
   - Determine test type
   - Follow naming conventions
   - Use AAA pattern
   - Meet coverage requirements

### Quick Decision Tree

```
"How should I structure this feature?"
├─ Check ARCHITECTURE.md: Layering Rules
└─ Check ARCHITECTURE.md: Package Organization

"Is my code following standards?"
├─ Check PROGRAMMING_PRACTICES.md: Code Review Checklist
└─ Check IDE warnings and compilation

"What tests do I need to write?"
├─ Check TESTING_STANDARDS.md: Test Types
└─ Check TESTING_STANDARDS.md: Coverage Requirements

"How do I name this method?"
├─ Check PROGRAMMING_PRACTICES.md: Java Conventions
└─ Check TESTING_STANDARDS.md: Test Naming (if test)

"Should I use a Pattern here?"
├─ Check ARCHITECTURE.md: Design Patterns
└─ Check if it solves actual problem
```

## 📊 Key Statistics & Thresholds

### Code Metrics

| Metric | Limit | Standard |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Method Length | 50 lines | 10-20 lines |
| Class Length | 500 lines | 200-300 lines |
| Line Length | 120 chars | 80-100 chars |
| Method Parameters | 5 | 2-3 preferred |
| Nesting Depth | 3 levels | 2 preferred |

### Test Coverage

| Layer | Minimum | Target |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Domain/Business | 85% | 95%+ |
| Services | 70% | 85%+ |
| Repositories | 70% | 80%+ |
| Controllers | 60% | 75%+ |
| Overall | 50% | 70%+ |

### Code Review Time Targets

- Small PR (< 100 lines): 15-30 minutes
- Medium PR (100-500 lines): 45-90 minutes
- Large PR (> 500 lines): Schedule separate meeting

---

## ✅ Enforcement Mechanisms

### Pre-Commit (Local)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd backend
mvn clean compile -q        # Must compile without warnings
mvn test -q                 # All tests must pass
```

### Pre-Push (GitHub)

- PR must have at least 1 approval
- All CI checks must pass
- Coverage cannot decrease
- No commented-out code

### CI/CD (Automated)

```bash
mvn clean compile       # Fail on warnings
mvn test               # All tests pass
mvn jacoco:report      # Coverage report
```
